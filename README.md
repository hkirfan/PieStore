# PieStore is a small demonstration of building a website using .NET 5 MVC. 
Through this project I explored .NET Core MVC framework concepts such as: 
1. Structure of .NET Core MVC web project,
2. Configuring StartUp and running the application,
3. Registering services in request pipeline,
4. Using MVC pattern to model functionality and rendering web pages - separation of concerns,
5. Using Entity Framework Core and Code-first migrations,
6. Asp .NET Core tag helpers, and
7. Asp .NET Core Identity for authentication and authorization.

Updated the project to .NET 5!
