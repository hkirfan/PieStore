# PieStore is a small demonstration of building a website using .NET Core MVC. 
Through this project I explored basic .NET Core MVC framework concepts such as: 
1. Structure of .NET Core MVC web project,
2. Configuring StartUp and running the application,
3. Registering services in request pipeline,
4. Using MVC pattern to model functionality and rendering web pages,
5. Using Entity Framework Core and Code-first migrations,
6. Asp .NET Core tag helpers, and
7. Asp .NET Core Identity for autnetication and authorization.
